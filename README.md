How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

I interpret user needs by gathering in a group, with the customers, and end users. Using the information they provide on what they would like to see. Creating "user stories" helps with this by adding the information into stories with each having a priority and main objective of what is needed for functionality.

How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Developing the project in iterations or increments, which allows for regular feedback and continuous improvement of the product. I hope to incorporate Scrum, and Kanban into my future development work. Scrum consists of regular sprints, daily stand-ups, and sprint reviews. Where Kanban focuses on visualizing work and managing the workflow to improve efficiency of the project.
